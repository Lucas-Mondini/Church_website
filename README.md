This is my first laravel project. I'm using PostgreSQL with database.

This is an idea to help the church in wich I congregate. Today the PASCOM (communication group) display the events, posts and v√≠deos on facebook, and it isn't very easy for people of age. So I decided to make a website that the PASCOM can display easily the content of the church.
